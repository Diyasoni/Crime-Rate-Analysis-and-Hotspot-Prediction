# Crime-Rate-Analysis-and-Hotspot-Prediction
In this project, we aim to leverage advanced data analytics and visualization techniques to understand crime patterns and identify high-risk areas within a city. By plotting crime centers on a map, we can provide valuable insights to law enforcement agencies and policymakers to enhance public safety and resource allocation.
